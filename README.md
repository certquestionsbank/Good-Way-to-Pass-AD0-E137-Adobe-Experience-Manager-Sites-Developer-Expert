## Effective Study Strategies

**Understand the Exam Objectives Thoroughly:** Start by reviewing the exam sections and understand the weightage of each topic. Focus on the areas with higher percentages, such as AEM development (33%) and Build and Deployment (25%), as these will likely have the most questions.
**Hands-On Experience:** Since AEM is highly practical, theoretical knowledge alone isn’t enough. Spend time developing components, templates, and workflows in an AEM instance. Practice configuring OSGi services, Sling models, and working with JCR nodes.
**Use Reliable Practice Questions:** Resources such as Certquestionsbank provide up-to-date [AD0-E137 practice questions](https://www.certquestionsbank.com/AD0-E137-exam.html) that mirror the exam format. Practicing these questions helps reinforce your understanding and improves time management during the actual test.
**Focus on Core Concepts:** Make sure you are comfortable with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework, Sling and Sightly (HTL), OSGi configuration, and content repository structure. Understanding these core concepts is essential for solving scenario-based questions.
**Learn Build and Deployment Tools:** Get familiar with tools such as Maven, CRX Package Manager, and AEM Dispatcher. Knowing how to manage builds, deploy content, and troubleshoot deployment issues is critical for this exam.
**Maintain AEM Environments:** Practice routine maintenance tasks like monitoring logs, managing replication agents, and troubleshooting server-side issues. These tasks often appear in environment maintenance questions.
**Time Management and Exam Strategy:** With 50 questions in 100 minutes, aim to spend roughly 2 minutes per question, leaving time for review. If a question seems difficult, move on and return later to ensure you answer all questions you know.
